# Neovim - Config: 

There's a lot in here that I'm not sure I really need, so this will be updated accordingly. 

What I do have that I want to keep
- `init.lua` has `.opt.number` and `.opt.relativenumber`, but there's some ways to include these options in another `options.lua` file that I'm sure I'm not utilizing correctly
- `plugins/render-markdown.lua` which works, but i've seen some better versions of this, so more configuration is needed
- `plugins/telescope.lua` is a neat one, but again isn't configured to its fullest potential
